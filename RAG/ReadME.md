# **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline for Learning from Research Papers**

This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline for learning from research papers using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach. It combines the power of retrieval-based search with the generative abilities of language models to answer queries based on the contents of a research paper PDF.

## **Key Concepts of RAG**

### **1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

RAG is a technique that combines **retrieval-based** methods and **generative** models:
- **Retrieval**: The system first retrieves relevant information from a large corpus (e.g., research papers, documents).
- **Augmented Generation**: A language model is then used to generate a response based on the retrieved information.

This approach allows a generative model to focus on creating more accurate and relevant content by using external information retrieved from large datasets.

### **2. Text Extraction from PDFs**

The pipeline starts by extracting the text from a research paper PDF using libraries like `pdfplumber` or `PyPDF2`. The text is then split into manageable chunks (such as paragraphs or sections).

---

### **3. Embeddings for Information Retrieval**

- **Embeddings** are vector representations of text. They are used to capture the semantic meaning of text.
- We use a pre-trained model (e.g., **Sentence-BERT** or **OpenAI embeddings**) to generate embeddings for each text chunk.

The embeddings are then indexed in a vector store like **FAISS**, which allows for fast retrieval of relevant chunks when a query is made.

---

### **4. Vector Stores for Efficient Search**

- A **vector store** is a database that stores embeddings in a way that allows for efficient retrieval.
- We use **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for storing and querying embeddings. FAISS uses **nearest-neighbor search** to find the closest embeddings to a given query.

### **5. Querying and Retrieval**

When a user asks a question, the system performs the following steps:
1. Convert the query into an embedding.
2. Perform a **nearest-neighbor search** in the vector store to retrieve the most relevant text chunks.
3. Return the top retrieved chunks to the model.

---

### **6. Generative Model for Answering Queries**

Once the relevant chunks are retrieved, the **generative model** (e.g., **GPT** or **T5**) is used to generate a response based on the provided context. The model uses both the retrieved information and the input query to produce a coherent and informative response.

## **Pipeline Overview**

The pipeline consists of the following steps:
1. **Extract Text**: Extract text from a research paper PDF.
2. **Chunk Text**: Split the text into chunks of manageable size.
3. **Generate Embeddings**: Use a pre-trained model to generate embeddings for each chunk.
4. **Build Vector Store**: Store the embeddings in a vector store (FAISS).
5. **Retrieve**: When a query is made, retrieve the most relevant text chunks.
6. **Generate**: Use a language model to generate answers based on the retrieved chunks.

## **Usage**

1. **Extract and Process a PDF**:
   ```python
   from rag_pipeline import RAGPipeline

   pipeline = RAGPipeline(pdf_path="research_paper.pdf")
   query = "Summarize the conclusion of the paper."
   print(pipeline.generate_answer(query))
   ```

2. **Query and Retrieve**:
   ```python
   query = "What is the methodology used in the study?"
   response = pipeline.generate_answer(query)
   print(response)
   ```
